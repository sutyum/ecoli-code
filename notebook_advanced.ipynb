Today, we're going to explore how we can use mathematics, biology, and computation to understand the challenge of transforming simple molecules into sustainable aviation fuel. This isn't just theory‚Äîit's cutting-edge research that could help solve climate change, but it's also one of the most challenging engineering problems of our time.\n",
